This virtual assistant can open any application that is installed on a Mac.

## How to use?

Just say in the app you want the assistant to open and it'll be done.

For example: You can say "Hey PyAssistant, Can you run Google Chrome for me?" and the assistant will open it for you.

Don't want to say the entire name of of an application? Just say "add nickname *nickname* for *App name*" in the given format.
For example: Type "add nickname Webex for Cisco Webex Meetings" and it'll be done!

Finally, if you want to exit just say "quit" or "bye" or "exit" or "stop" or "ciao" and it will shut down shutdown.

It can also search for stuff on Google. Just ask!

## Note

This program creates an *apps.json* file the first time you run it to get the paths of all the applications installed on your mac. This is done to ensure fast loading of apps for future use.

It also creates a *nacknames.json* file to store the nicknames given to the applications
